If the current ItemInstance code is not working for you here is how it is set up.
All ItemInstances are stored in a group in their respective object.
$ItemInstance::Group also holds all of these groups and loaded (but not attached) groups.
There are additional functions that you have access to that affect the inner workings of the script.
but are not described here.
